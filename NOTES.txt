Notes 1:
Phase 1: artifatcs were discovered
mentio previous work
take trienkos references
evolution of artifacts over time and give examples from literature

phase 2: artifacts can be described
short review of trinkos papers
paper1 study of EW array and such
paper 2 and 3

phase 3: Simulations in new papers
EUR papers
look for what references trinkos +- 3 of them
barnfield is one of them maybe




There is still scope to sstuyd in thery
Theory has struggled since the simulation papers
This is what my paper will do
Extended emmisons is not far fetched so its as valid as simulations
Modeling galatcic center with hera telescope, <- refer to this to make it connect to literature


Expand calibration before getting to artifacts in intro
Smirnov complex optimisation and other papers

Mention that is is practive to use point source models as extended sources, reference hera again



Intro is the literature review

Next is Reviewing extrapolation and previous results
replicate just one ghost pattern from kat 7
Review Extrapolation technique

make a nice drawing of the scneraions from the email.
^
Experimental setup


Then show results

Then in conclusion
Read results from simulation papers and link it back to my results
One of them talks about extended emmisons. Different baselines would suppress them differently

Introduction
Extrapolation and previous results
Experimental setup - Extended Emmission experiment
Results
Conclusion


Experiement
Recreate trinkos results first from paper 2
Change sky model input from point sources to models in docuement, gaussians: extrended emmisons and point sources
Can read in calibration model and sky model as gaussians and point sources
Then in the code implement fourier transform of gaussian,   already in code but not in the same way, g_kernal variable is restoring beam, e.g the gaussian, change sigma to something else to see that the sources get bigger
Look at space science, papino and paperino
Fourier transform of gaussian is a gaussian, could be shifted by multiplyinh by complex exponential
Change output image, it currently convolves with gaussian envelope and thats why it looks so nice so point sources dont look like dots.
With guassians it might look okay without the convolutiuon, otherwise it might still be needed, but keep in mind that changes the shape of the gaussian input, make sure to report that we used a "clean beam"
See what happens ^ Does it look okay without or is it needed
divide it out to get its actual flux. 

Notes 2:

check table befoew apendix
check absolute value graphs
equation 38 paper 2, beta detrines how much real and imaginary
check wavelength is correct
change beta value to correct flux
add percent of A2 to CM
add param for type_w
replicate fig 15 and 16

sky model is fed in when initialie ghost object , you pass in point source array
pass in gaussian instead of point_sources
pass in position and size, need 1 extra paramater for size, in point_sources maybe
g_kernal is fft of gaussian at center, make it shift with an e value
image a guassian fitst to make this work, check papino and paperino, use gaussian at center


Notes 3:

Plot suppression ghost Percentage as function of baseline length
Suppression ghost will be the same for all baseline lenghts in normal emmisions
For extended emmison case this will not be the case, the baseline lenghts will influence it.

Page 2350 X axis should be baseline now
Find image from original email NB Create these sky models

change R = np.zeros(u_t_m.shape) and M to be gaussians
R is true and M is model
Big circle means extended emmisions Dot means point source and x mean no value
7 and 2 are important experiemnts


# ? Fourier Transform of a Gaussian:
# if gaussian is F_x(x) = e**(-a*x**2)
# Then transform is F_x(k) = np.sqrt(np.pi/a) * np.exp(-np.pi**2 * k**2 / a)
